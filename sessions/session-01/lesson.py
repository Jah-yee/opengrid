# # Session 1: supply must equal demand, every second
# **A. Real-world problem.** Electricity cannot be stored in the wires. The power that
# generators push in must match the power that homes and factories draw out, second by second.
# If demand is higher than supply, the whole grid slows down a little and the frequency
# (50 Hz in India and Europe) sags. Grid operators watch that one number all day.
#
# **Plan.** (1) a demand curve through a day, (2) a small fleet of generators that ramp up and
# down, (3) the balance bar: supply minus demand, (4) how the imbalance moves the frequency.
